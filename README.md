# 🧱 Blockchain Simulator

A **Blockchain Simulator** built with **ReactJS (frontend)** and **Spring Boot (backend)** , database **Monog DB** that demonstrates how blockchain technology works — including block creation, proof-of-work mining, transaction validation, and chain verification.  

This project helps learners, developers, and researchers understand the **core concepts of blockchain** by simulating the process visually and programmatically.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Block Creation** — Create new blocks containing transaction data.  
✅ **Mining Process Simulation** — See how the Proof-of-Work algorithm secures the network.  
✅ **Hash Generation** — Each block automatically generates a unique SHA-256 hash.  
✅ **Chain Validation** — Detect tampered or invalid blocks.  
✅ **Transaction History** — View details of all blocks in the blockchain.  
✅ **Interactive UI** — Simple and responsive design built with ReactJS.  
✅ **RESTful Backend** — Powered by Spring Boot for blockchain logic and data persistence.
